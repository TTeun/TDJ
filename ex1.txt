Exercise 1

a) 
	#include <iostream>

	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		cout << "Hello World \n";
	}

b) The commands for compilation and linking
	
	g++-5 -std=c++14 -Wall -o hello hello.cc	to obtain the executable hello
	g++-5 -std=c++14 -c hello.cc				to obtain the object file hello.o

c) Description of object file and executable

	The object file is generated by the compiler. It is the translation of the source code into machine code.
	The executable is the runable file which is constracted by the compiler in the linking phase.

d) The Output of the programm is:

	Hello World

e) The size in bytes of:

	the source file = 86 bytes
	the object file = 2544 bytes
	the executable program (stripped) = 6272 bytes
	the file iostream = 2695 bytes
